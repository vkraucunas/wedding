                <h2 class="major">First there was software.</h2>
                <p>They met through <strong>Tinder</strong> in November 2014. There, now hopefully the awkward part of the story is over.</p>
                <p>He caught her by suprise the second time they saw each other by bringing over Chinese takeout and
                 cider while she packed up a room full of stuff to make space for a new roommate.</p>
                <p>After a few months of spending time together, we went ahead and uninstalled the dating app.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Then they moved in together.</h2>
                <p>July 2015, she moved in with him. She took so long to unpack her things, he thought she was making it easy to pick up and run.</p>
                <p>She eventually gave away her mattress to prove otherwise.</p>
                <p>Several furniture reconfigurations, mushroom risotto dinners, and tv binges later, our house feels like a home together.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Why not software?</h2>
                <p>After years of doing administrative work, she was ready for a change. It took a lot of self-reflection but in the end she determined exercising creativity was most fulfilling for her. He suggested she investigate software engineering, and when she drug her feet, he dragged her along to see <a href="https://www.codedoc.co/">CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Galvanize</h2>
                <p>Starting in January 2016, she went through Galvanize and became a software engineer. Meaning our home was now full of nerds.</p>
                <p>While she pushed through the rigorous curriculum, he made sure she didn't lose her mind by setting her up with a monthly massage, and continuing their tradition monthly pedicures together.</p>

                <h2 class="major">From corporate to cannabis</h2>

                <h2 class="major">Partners in... software and what not</h2>
                <p>Where these two go from here, is unknown.  Yet you can be damn sure they will be having fun together
                <p></p>
