                <h2 class="major">First there was software.</h2>
                <p>They met through <strong>Tinder</strong> in November 2014. There, now hopefully the awkward part of the story is over.</p>
                <p>He caught her by suprise the second time they saw each other by bringing over Chinese takeout and
                 cider while she packed up a room full of stuff to make space for a new roommate.</p>
                <p>After a few months of spending time together, we went ahead and uninstalled the dating app.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Then they moved in together.</h2>
                <p>July 2015, she moved in with him. She took so long to unpack her things, he thought she was making it easy to pick up and run. She eventually gave away her mattress to prove otherwise.</p>
                <p>Several furniture reconfigurations, mushroom risotto dinners, and tv binges later, their house feels like a home together.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Why not software?</h2>
                <p>After years of doing administrative work, she was ready for a change. It took a lot of self-reflection but in the end she determined exercising creativity was most fulfilling for her. He suggested she investigate software engineering, and when she drug her feet, he dragged her along to see <a href="https://www.codedoc.co/"><em>CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap</em></a>.</p>
                <p>She had her application in for a coding school soon after.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Code school madness.</h2>
                <p>Starting in January 2016, she went through Galvanize and became a software engineer. Meaning their home was now full of nerds.</p>
                <p>While she pushed through the rigorous curriculum, he made sure she didn't lose her mind by gifting her a good set of headphones, setting her up with a monthly massage, and continuing their tradition monthly pedicures together.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Dovetailing skills.</h2>
                <p>They're both left handed, like ketchup in their mac 'n' cheese, and enjoy tech speaking, but beyond that they handle life pretty differently. She's a planner and organization addict. He's a tinkerer who flits from project to project. He likes coffee, she prefers tea. He shows her advanced software architectures. She shows him design tools. She likes to cook. He doesn't hate doing dishes. It works. ðŸ˜‰</p>
                <p>This offset of each other's skills makes life more comfortable and interesting.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Partners in... software and what not.</h2>
                <p>Now they both work in cannabis tech, live in a little house with a mini-zoo, and celebrate the wins of life together. They make each other laugh a lot; the deep, unguarded laughter that only comes with people you love and trust. The plan is to keep that up.</p>
